        \item Worked on the \href{https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity}{Play Integrity API}, a high-scale C++ platform assessing device-side integrity on over 1 billion Android devices daily
		\item Designed and implemented a principled pipeline to process device data for emulators, producing real-time integrity verdicts
        % \item Added monitoring metrics and a graphical dashboard to this system to allow the onduty to recognize and respond to scaled abuse
        \item Extended the system that calculates preexisting integrity verdicts, increasing configurability, scalability, and debuggability

      \begin{cvitems}
		\item Built a testing system in C++ to test the resource discovery system of \href{https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy}{Envoy} (open-source L7 proxy) with randomized input paths
        % \item Wrote a fuzz target for Envoy's xDS protocol, which provides a centralized infrastructure for distributing config files to Envoy nodes
        \item Implemented an abstract state tracker that maintained the correct state of the system to ensure updates were properly processed
		\item Increased test coverage by 40\% on key files, uncovering and fixing multiple production bugs
